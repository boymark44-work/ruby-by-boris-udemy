puts guitar #* #<Guitar:0x0000013169a0c710>

#* As you can see, the latter output returns the same object location.
#* That is Ruby's default string representation of our object. 



#* Now, we can override the to_s method using our own definition of that method.
class Guitar

  end
end

guitar = Guitar.new  
puts guitar.to_s #* => "An Acoustic Alder guitar with 6 strings."
puts guitar #* => "An Acoustic Alder guitar with 6 strings."

#* In summary, we can override the default to_s method to customize the string representation
#* of our custom object.
